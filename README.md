## 🧠 How It Works

When a user enters product details,  
→ We use **Google Gemini LLM API** to deeply understand the product.  
→ It instantly generates smart, optimized product descriptions.  
→ Simultaneously, we run **Playwright** to scrape Meesho live.  
→ We collect pricing data from **real competitors** selling similar items.  
→ Our pricing engine calculates the most **competitive & profitable price**.  
→ All this is packed into a smooth, fast app built using the **MERN stack**.  
→ UI is styled beautifully with **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI**.

> ⚡ It's AI + Live Data, working together to help sellers grow.
